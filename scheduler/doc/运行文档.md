## Deploy Steps
Running on a live kubernetes cluster with GoLand IDE

### Step 1: Add CRDs and ConfigMaps to cluster
Create the CustomResourceDefinition you need. For example, a typical CRD with kind myapp.

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: myapps.app.example.com
spec:
  group: app.example.com
  names:
    kind: MyApp
    listKind: MyAppList
    plural: myapps
    singular: myapp
  scope: Namespaced
  version: v1alpha1
```

Create a ConfigMap named custom-resources, list all the CustomResources kinds you need to watch in data field.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: custom-resources
  namespace: default
data:
  resources.1: myapps
```
Then apply it to Kubernetes cluster.
### Step 2: Open project in GoLand IDE
Open the project $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/kubernetes in GoLand.
In the menu, choose GoLand -> Preferences, on the left, choose Go -> GOPATH。Remove all the items in global GoPATH and add your current GoPATH in Project GOPATH. Uncheck 'Use GOPATH that's defined in system environment' and check 'Index entire GOPATH'.

### Step 3: Add code to kube-scheduler source code
Find $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go, namely original `scheduler.go`.


Copy all the code snippets in `file <RepoPath>/diff.go` to the end of `scheduler.go`, resolve all the import and package problems.

Then find `func (sched *Scheduler) Run()` in original `scheduler.go`(around line 281), change it as shown below.

```go
func (sched *Scheduler) Run() {
	if !sched.config.WaitForCacheSync() {
		return
	}
	go wait.Until(sched.scheduleOne, 0, sched.config.StopEverything)
	go transfomers()
}
```

find `func(sched *Scheduler) scheduleOne()` in original `scheduler.go`, insert several lines of code behind `suggestedHost, err := sched.schedule(pod)` (around line 540). After the insertion, `func(sched *Scheduler) scheduleOne()` should look like this:

```go
func (sched *Scheduler) scheduleOne() {
	[...]
	// Synchronously attempt to find a fit for the pod.
	start := time.Now()
	suggestedHost, err := sched.schedule(pod)

	// Inserted
	if pod.GetAnnotations()["proxy"] != "" {
		Hack(suggestedHost, pod)
	}

	if err != nil {
		// schedule() may have failed because the pod would not fit on any host, so we try to
		// preempt, with the expectation that the next time the pod is tried for scheduling it
		// will fit due to the preemption. It is also possible that a different pod will schedule
		// into the resources that were preempted, but this is harmless.
		if fitError, ok := err.(*core.FitError); ok {
		[...]
```

Then you need to resolve all the import problems.

### Step 4: Run it in IDE
Find $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kube-scheduler/scheduler.go, and there is a `func main()`. Run it, then you can see `go build scheduler.go` on the right-top corner of the interface, click it, choose Edit Configurations -> find Program arguments -> fill in Program arguments with ’--kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf --scheduler-name=crdscheduler‘ 

Make sure you have '/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf' file, and you can run it.

After you run it in IDE, you can try to create a CustomResource object in cluster with YAML file:

```
apiVersion:app.example.com/v1alpha1
kind: MyApp
metadata:
  name: test-app1
spec:
  requests:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 250Mi
  shFile: "/usr/local/tomcat/apache-tomcat-8.5.35/bin/startup.sh"
```
Create it in cluster.


Then, when you use `kubectl describe myapp test-app1` to get test-app1's infomation, you can find that Node Name in spec field has been updated to the name of the node where test-app1 should be scheduled:
```
